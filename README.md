# Distributed Algorithms course labs (IN4150)

### Lab 1: Birman-Schiper-Stephenson algorithm for **causal ordering** of broadcast messages
Implement the Birman-Schiper-Stephenson algorithm for causal ordering of broadcast messages
with Java/RMI. The implemented program should be truly distributed in that the it can be demonstrated to run across multiple physical machines.

### Lab 2: Peterson’s **election** algorithm in a unidirectional ring
Implement Peterson’s algorithm for election in a unidirectional ring with Java/RMI. The implemented program should be truly distributed in that it can be demonstrated to run across multiple
physical machines. 

### Lab 3: TBA
